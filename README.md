# MultiProgressBar
MultiProgressBar show many Progress bars in parallel


![example](https://github.com/ryosukee/MultiProgressBar/blob/master/example.gif)
See `example.py`

There are still some hard cording to use MultiProgressBar as show in `example.py`.  
I would like to eliminate these specification.
